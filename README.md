# robo_advisor
Repo Setup
Use the GitHub.com online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "robo-advisor". When prompted by the GitHub.com online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub.com at an address like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/robo-advisor.

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

cd ~/Desktop/robo-advisor
Use your text editor or the command-line to create a new sub-directory called "app" with a file called "robo_advisor.py", and then place the following contents inside:

# app/robo_advisor.py

print("-------------------------")
print("SELECTED SYMBOL: XYZ")
print("-------------------------")
print("REQUESTING STOCK MARKET DATA...")
print("REQUEST AT: 2018-02-20 02:00pm")
print("-------------------------")
print("LATEST DAY: 2018-02-20")
print("LATEST CLOSE: $100,000.00")
print("RECENT HIGH: $101,000.00")
print("RECENT LOW: $99,000.00")
print("-------------------------")
print("RECOMMENDATION: BUY!")
print("RECOMMENDATION REASON: TODO")
print("-------------------------")
print("HAPPY INVESTING!")
print("-------------------------")
Make sure to save Python files like this whenever you're done editing them. After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to run this file.

Use your text editor or the command-line to create a new file called "requirements.txt", and then place the following contents inside:

requests
python-dotenv
After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to install these packages.


Environment Setup
Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

conda create -n stocks-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate stocks-env
From within the virtual environment, install the required packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file you created:

pip install -r requirements.txt
From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

python app/robo_advisor.py
If you see the example output, you're ready to move on to project development. This would be a great time to make any desired modifications to your project's "README.md" file (like adding instructions for how to setup and run the app like you've just done), and then make your first commit, with a message like "Setup the repo".
